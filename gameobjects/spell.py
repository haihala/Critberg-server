A card that after doing it's effect is moved to the graveyard.


TODO: Spell speed.
I was thinking about an integer method, where each spell has a speed property, and if a spells speed is higher (or equal) then the spell on top of the stack it can be played.
This separates us further away from mtg (+), reduces possibility of easy massive stacks (+ for new players), gives one more lever to adjust when a card is out of balance (+), but reduces stack manipulation fuckery that some like in magic (-)
